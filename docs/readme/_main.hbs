> High quality eCAD parts made by me. Shared with you.

KiCad assets for parts I'm
using in my designs. These are parts that I couldn't find eCAD resources for on
the internet, so I made them by hand.

Most of these parts are available on
Digikey. Look for a link to Digikey in the symbol metadata.

## Compatibility

KiCad 6.0 and above

## Adding a part

- Add symbol to library using eSchema
- Add footprint to `rhinodavid.pretty` directory
- Add STEP file to `rhinodavid.pretty` directory
  - Make sure the 3D model is assigned to and properly positioned on the footprint
- Add images to `./docs/readme/img`
- Update `./docs/readme/data.json` with the new part
- Regenerate the README
  - This requires the [Handlebars CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs-cli)
  - Run `./docs/readme/generate.sh`
